Oxford University didn't follow suit until 30 years later, and Jesus College at Cambridge University did not begin admitting female students until 1974.\n\nIt's also why, from the very start, talented students of all backgrounds were given the chance to access further education through bursaries and scholarships.\n\nToday we offer hundreds of scholarships to support and encourage talented students, and a range of grants and bursaries to those who need a financial helping hand.",

        "University Introduction Content 2": "Established through a 1909 Act of State Parliament, The University of Queensland was the first university in the state and was officially founded on April 16, 1910, with the gazettal of appointments to the first UQ Senate. Teaching started in 1911 in Old Government House in George Street, Brisbane. In the first year there were three faculties – Arts, Science and Engineering – and 83 students (60 men and 23 women).\n\nAfter World War I, the University expanded rapidly and soon outgrew its inner-city location. In 1922, an additional site in Victoria Park (now occupied by the Medical School) was secured. Four years later, Dr James O’Neil Mayne and his sister Miss Mary Emelia Mayne provided funds to buy the St Lucia site where the University’s main campus is now located. Construction started on the St Lucia site in 1937 and the first building, later named the Forgan Smith Building after the Premier of the day, was completed in 1939. During World War II, it became the advanced headquarters for the Allied Land Forces in the South West Pacific.\nIn 1990, the University merged with the Queensland Agricultural College at (now Gatton), 80 kilometres west of Brisbane, resulting in the union of the two oldest higher education institutions in the State and producing a substantial increase in enrolments. The former Queensland Agricultural College enrolled its first students in 1897 and the two institutions had a long history of cooperation in teaching and research activities.\n\nIn 1999, UQ opened a major campus in the provincial centre of Ipswich, taking over a site previously used by the Challinor Centre mental health facility. In January 2015 this campus transferred to the University of Southern Queensland but UQ continued to teach at the USQ Ipswich campus until 2016 to assist particular students complete their studies. \n\nEstablished in 2010, UQ’s major clinical health and research teaching location at Herston is now UQ's third campus.",

No other single Australian university serves such a large area of the continent, in such a remote location and with such a small population to sustain it. \n\nWhile the Northern Territory covers around 16 percent of Australia, in 2015 it was home to just over 1 percent of the population, 30 percent of whom were Indigenous compared with around 3 percent of the general Australian population.\n\nThe only university based in the Northern Territory, CDU is a dual sector university. We are the most northerly Australian university, literally on Asia’s doorstep. Closer in many respects to the vast populations of Asia than to the southern Australian states.\n\nOurs is a university deeply engaged with, and informed by, Australia’s Indigenous people. Recognising that we operate on the lands of many strong Indigenous nations, respecting the knowledge and culture of Aboriginal people and committed to Indigenous advancement.\n\nThese are truly unique features that CDU embraces as both challenges and opportunities for the years ahead, building on the strong foundations and remarkable achievements of our 25-year history. \n\nIn this relatively short space of time, we have developed a reputation as one of the most innovative teaching and learning and most research-intensive universities in Australia and have risen to the ranks of the top 2 percent of world universities in 2015.\n\nCDU has provided and will continue to provide, the human capital that underpins the future prosperity of Northern Australia and our near Asian region, while also providing innovative and flexible online learning choices for a broader national student market.",

The forerunners of today’s UniSA were the South Australian School of Art, founded in 1856, the first of several Teacher Training Colleges formed in 1876, and the School of Mines and Industries which was established in 1889. These schools were renowned for providing quality education and for responding to the needs of the nascent colony of South Australia.\n\nUnder the University's Act, our mission was \"to preserve, extend and disseminate knowledge through teaching, research, scholarship and consultancy, and to provide educational programs that will enhance the diverse cultural life of the wider community.\"\n\nA faculty structure was adopted in 1992, and in 1993 UniSA established the Australian Technology Network (ATN) with the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Curtin University of Technology in Perth, RMIT University in Melbourne and the University of Technology, Sydney.\n\nIn 1994, the first two research institutes the Ian Wark Research Institute and the Institute for Telecommunications Research were established, followed in 1996 by the Flexible Learning Centre, which played a major role in facilitating strategic directions for improving teaching and learning.\n\nIn 1997, UniSA became one of the first universities to identify seven Graduate Qualities, which remain central to our teaching and learning framework, and adopted a Statement of Commitment to Aboriginal Reconciliation.",

Funds were raised by public subscription to establish a college of university rank in Bangor. An important feature of its foundation was the voluntary contributions made by local people, including farmers and quarrymen, from their weekly wages over a period of time.\n\nOpening its doors in 1884...\nThe University was founded as the University College of North Wales. It opened its doors on 18 October 1884 in an old coaching inn with 58 students and 10 members of staff. The students received degrees from the University of London until 1893 when the University of Wales, Bangor became one of the three original constituent colleges of the University of Wales .\n\nThe location...\nThe University was originally based in an old coaching inn called the Penrhyn Arms. In 1903, the city of Bangor donated a 10-acre site overlooking the city at Penrallt for a new building, and substantial sums of money were raised by local people to help meet the cost. The foundation stone for this was laid in 1907, and four years later in 1911 the main building was opened, together with some arts and social science buildings and part of the Library.\n\nThe Science Departments remained in the Penrhyn Arms for another fifteen years. In 1926 they moved to new purpose-built accommodation which had been constructed with the assistance of funds raised by the North Wales Heroes Memorial.",

Originally known as Southeast Missouri State Normal School, the first classes were taught at the nearby Lorimier School until April 1875 when the first normal school building was completed.\nThe original Normal School building burned down on April 8, 1902, and was replaced in 1906 by Academic Hall, the school's domed landmark building. It was designed by Jerome Bibb Legg, who also designed the St. Louis Exposition and Music Hall, and includes light fixtures from the 1904 World's Fair.",
        "University Introduction Content 2": "Vision\nSoutheast Missouri State University strives to be one of the nation’s most academically competitive regional comprehensive universities, recognized for excellence in education, research, engagement, and creativity.\n\nMission\nSoutheast Missouri State University provides student‐centered education and experiential learning with a foundation of liberal arts and sciences, embracing a tradition of access, exceptional teaching, and commitment to student success that significantly contributes to the development of the region and beyond.",

We are taking important steps to assess how we are doing and where we need to improve. While off to a good start, we know our work is far from complete.\n\nI am proud that our community is using the occasion of our Bicentennial to examine our past and present to inform how we can best achieve our aspirations for diversity, equity and inclusion in our third century. Through classes, a theme semester, art exhibits and performances, and scholarly discussions, we are fostering the types of activities that help us learn as a community and better understand our differences.\n\n“The University of Michigan cannot be excellent without being diverse in the broadest sense of that word. We also must ensure that our community allows all individuals an equal opportunity to thrive.”",

        "University Introduction Content 1": "Kent State University was established in 1910 as an institution for training public school teachers. It was part of the Lowry Bill, which also created a sister school in Bowling Green, Ohio – now known as Bowling Green State University. It was initially known under the working name of the Ohio State Normal College At Kent, but was named Kent State Normal School in 1911 in honor of William S. Kent (son of Kent, Ohio, namesake Marvin Kent), who donated the 53 acres (21 ha) used for the original campus. As such, it is the only public university in Ohio named for an individual.[dubious – discuss] The first president was John Edward McGilvrey, who served from 1912 to 1926.McGilvrey had an ambitious vision for the school as a large university, instructing architect George F. Hammond, who designed the original campus buildings, to produce a master plan.Classes began in 1912 before any buildings had been completed at the campus in Kent. These classes were held at extension centers in 25 cities around the region. By May 1913, classes were being held on the campus in Kent with the opening of Merrill Hall.The school graduated 34 students in its first commencement on July 29, 1914. In 1915, the school was renamed Kent State Normal College[15] due to the addition of four-year degrees.",

        "University Introduction Content 2": "A small, private teacher training school opened 1899. After the community’s efforts to sustain the college failed, the Ball brothers purchased the land and buildings of the defunct institution and donated them to the State of Indiana. This gift became the Indiana State Normal School Eastern Division, which opened in 1918 to meet Indiana’s need for more and better teachers.\n\nIn recognition of the Ball family’s generosity, the Indiana General Assembly changed the school's name to Ball Teachers College in 1922 and then Ball State Teachers College in 1929.\n\nThe College Becomes a University\n\nBy the 1960s, the regional teachers college had begun to attract faculty from outside the Midwest, and students sought majors in areas such as business, architecture, and other emerging disciplines. Enrollment and funding surged with national trends, and new facilities and degree offerings were added.\n\nIn 1965, the Indiana General Assembly renamed the college Ball State University, acknowledging its phenomenal growth in enrollment and facilities, the variety and quality of its educational programs and services, and the anticipation of the broader role it would play in the state’s future.",

        "University Introduction Content 1": "Founded in 1878 as Ashland College, the name of the institution was changed to Ashland University on May 12, 1989. This change was a practical and logical step based on the many diverse undergraduate, graduate and professional programs offered by the institution.\n\nAshland continues to have a rich tradition as a private, comprehensive institution preparing students for exciting professions and careers. The University consists of four academic colleges -- College of Arts & Sciences, Dauch College of Business & Economics, Schar College of Education and Schar College of Nursing and Health Sciences -- as well as the Graduate, Online and Adult Studies; the Founders School for Continuing Education; and Ashland Theological Seminary.\n\nAshland University places great emphasis on the importance of each individual. The phrase “Accent on the Individual” has been our motto for many years and characterizes well the nature and content of the campus environment. It means that our concern for the student extends beyond ensuring a quality education in the classroom and laboratory to include a commitment to provide a stimulating and supportive environment in every respect. Translating the ideas of the Mission Statement into the realities of everyday life is the responsibility of each Ashland University employee. These ideas must be evidenced daily in the classroom, residence halls, each teaching site, on the playing fields and in our interaction with others. It should be the goal of each Ashland University employee to ensure that our Mission Statement is not merely words on paper but a true reflection of who and what we actually are and intend to be in the future.",
        "University Introduction Content 2": "I am deeply honored to serve as president of Ashland University, and am enthusiastic about working with the faculty and staff at this outstanding institution. Ashland University’s emphasis on the unique educational interests and trajectory of every student, reflected in our recurring “accent on the individual,” has created a campus environment that is compassionate, responsive and challenging.\n\nDr. Carlos Campo\nPresident, Ashland University",

The Roman Catholic church founded Saint Mary's College in Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1802. It was established in Glebe House, on the corner of Spring Garden Road and Barrington Street, with the aim of extending educational opportunities for Catholic youth and training candidates for the clergy.\nIn 1840 the Nova Scotia Legislature bestowed the degree granting charter to Saint Mary’s and eleven years later granted the University formal legal status. Saint Mary's collapsed in 1883, but was revived in 1903 by Cornelius O'Brien, then Archbishop of Halifax. It reopened as a high school in a new campus on Windsor Street, near the junction with Quinpool Road.",

        "University Introduction Content 1": "Established in 1965 as Algoma College, Algoma University was initially an affiliate of Laurentian University in Sudbury. In 1967, Algoma College began offering classes in portable building located at the Cambrian College site, now Sault College site. Algoma College moved into its current location, the former Shingwauk Residential School building, in 1971.\n\nFormer students of the Shingwauk Residential School formed the Children of Shingwauk Alumni Association and have helped guide the development of education on the Shingwauk site.  A provincial trust, the Shingwauk Education Trust, gives ownership of a portion of the site to Anishinaabek people, and Shingwauk Kinoomaage Gamig (SKG) has developed as an Anishinaabek institution for university studies on the site. Algoma signed a Covenant (PDF) in 2006 with SKG to work together for the benefit of all students of Algoma and Shingwauk.\n\nIn 2008, Algoma University was granted its charter and with the charter, achieved full autonomous university status as Ontario’s 19th University. Algoma University now offers over 30 academic programs in a diverse range of fields and through three faculties: Faculty of Sciences, Faculty of Social Sciences and Faculty of Humanities.",
        "University Introduction Content 2": "We celebrate the values, personalities, and convictions that make each of us unique - because they also bring us together.\n\nWhen you look back at your Algoma U experience, our hope is that it will be defined by more than what you’ve learned in the classroom. That’s why we are heavily focused on campus culture, vibrant programming, research and innovation, Anishinaabe Inendamowin, and overall institutional excellence. This is a place where you’ll connect with the most diverse student body in Ontario. Where you’ll benefit from dedicated and caring faculty. Where you’ll find your true self and more.",

        "University Introduction Content 2": "The University's foundation stone was laid by King George V on 19 July 1920 and 89 students (including eight female students) enrolled that same year. By September 1939, there were 65 staff and 485 students.\n\nIn 1947 there were just two permanent buildings on campus: Singleton Abbey and the library. The Principal, J S Fulton, recognised the need to expand the estate and had a vision of a self-contained community, with residential, social and academic facilities on a single site. His vision was to become the first university campus in the UK.\n\nBy 1960 a large-scale development programme was underway that would see the construction of new halls of residence, the Maths and Science Tower, and College House (later renamed Fulton House). The 1960s also saw the development of the \"finite element method\" by Professor Olek Zienkiewicz. His technique revolutionised the design and engineering of manufactured products, and Swansea was starting to stake its claim as an institution that demanded to be taken seriously.",

        "University Introduction Content 1": "In 2016, Brunel celebrated 50 years as a university.  However, our history can be traced back much further to 1798 through our predecessor colleges of Borough Road College, Maria Grey College, Shoreditch College and the West London Institute of Higher Education and as well as through Acton Technical College then Brunel College.  Our rise since 1966 has been impressive and our reputation grows year on year.  Now a university of 12,746 students – 3,309 students engaged in postgraduate and research study – our special approach is to combine academic rigour with the practical, entrepreneurial and imaginative approach pioneered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. \n\nThe decision to be named after Isambard Kingdom Brunel was taken after much discussion.  Rather than name the new College after a location, Dr Topping, the first Vice Chancellor of Brunel University (and former Principal of Brunel College) pleaded that the name should be a well-known person preferably an engineer or scientist associated in some way with Middlesex or Acton.  Agreement was reached in March 1957 that person would be Isambard Kingdom Brunel.\n\nIsambard Kingdom Brunel (1806-1859)  is one of the great British engineers of the 19th century. Isambard was born into an industrious family in 1806, with his mother Sophia Kingdom working for the Royal Navy and father Marc Brunel being a prominent French engineer. Isambard took on formal training as an engineer and went on to build twenty-five railways lines, over a hundred bridges, including five suspension bridges, eight pier and dock systems, three ships and a pre-fabricated army field hospital.To add to this he was a keen social engineer, building housing estates, churches and hospitals.",
        "University Introduction Content 2": "When Brunel was awarded its Royal Charter in 1966 we were given a distinct purpose and an incredible opportunity. The campus was to be the home of technological education, championing innovation and advancement, and giving the UK the knowledge base it needed to compete on the international stage.\n\nWe conceived a brand of education, and later research, which was overwhelmingly geared towards the needs of industry and, echoing the spirit and vision of our namesake Isambard Kingdom Brunel, we did so with flair and rigour. Our ambition was to equip students for the world of work and to address society’s challenges on a global scale.\n\nThe challenges have changed, but our aims are as innovative and ambitious as they always were – to develop research and educational programmes informed by, and tailor-made for, those who benefit; and to give students the academic education and personal skills needed to become a success in the real world.\n\nThis publication identifies five distinct areas of focus – each of which underpins our vision until 2030. It recognises the values upon which Brunel’s success is founded. And, though our strategy as educators and innovators will change in the intervening years, these goals, values and vision will remain at the heart of everything we do and the driving force behind our future achievements, ensuring Brunel continues to meet the needs of a changing world until 2030 and beyond.",

This Grade II listed building, build in the Gothic style, inspired the term ‘redbrick university’, now used to refer to a set of British universities established in leading industrial English cities during the Victorian age.\n\nThe university’s motto translates into English as ‘These days of peace foster learning’.\n\nIt became an independent university and adopted the name the University of Liverpool, in 1903.\n\nToday, the university is home to around 30,000 students, including 7,000 international students from 127 countries, as well as 195,000 alumni and 6,000 staff.\n\nAmong its alumni are the broadcast journalist Jon Snow, and former Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy, while nine Nobel Laureates have passed through its doors.\n\nIt also claims a presence on every continent, including a Chinese joint venture university in the World Heritage City of Suzhou (Liverpool was the first UK higher education institution to establish an independent university in China), to research stations located in the Arctic.\n\nAs well as being the birthplace of the Beatles, the city of Liverpool also boasts the most number of museums and galleries in the UK outside of London, and was designated the European Capital of Culture in 2008.\n\nAccording to Rough Guides, the travel guides series, Liverpool is the fourth friendliest city in the world.",

Since then we have become a dynamic, multi-campus university with a total of 17,500 students. Our main campuses are located in Townsville and Cairns, and we have international campuses in Singapore and Brisbane.\n\nAfter a decade under the stewardship of the University of Queensland, JCU became a university in its own right on 20 April 1970. The proclamation was signed by Queen Elizabeth II at a special ceremony in Townsville, which took place 200 years, to the day, after the University’s namesake, explorer Captain James Cook, first sighted Australia. Read a brief history of JCU spanning 1957 to 2008.",
        "University Introduction Content 2": "On his first Pacific voyage and under royal orders, the then Lieutenant James Cook, aboard HM Bark Endeavour, observed and recorded the transit of Venus at Tahiti then sailed on and charted the coast of New Zealand, the east coast of Australia and part of the southern coast of New Guinea.\n\nDuring this voyage the young officer set foot on Australian shores only twice; the first at a landing point he would name Botany Bay; the second two months later when the Endeavour grounded on a reef off the north east coast of the country. The ship was successfully beached in sheltered waters on a river mouth while it underwent repairs. This location was 260 kilometres north of Cairns, and the settlement there became Cooktown. Many coastal features in our region were named by Cook, including Green Island, Cape Tribulation, Dunk Island and Magnetic Island, to name just a few.\n\nContinuing in his footsteps, James Cook University aims to encourage and support world-class research and exploration to provide the knowledge and understanding needed to meet the challenges facing northern Australia and the tropics worldwide.",

At Griffith, remarkable is the norm.\n\nSince we started teaching over 40 years ago, we’ve been deeply connected to the Asian region, socially conscious and environmentally aware, an integral part of the community and heavily industry focused. We’ve also become a comprehensive, research-intensive university, ranking in the top 2% of universities worldwide.\n\nOur teaching and research spans six campuses in South East Queensland and all disciplines, while our network of more than 200,000 graduates extends around the world.",
        "University Introduction Content 2": "We believe in a remarkable tomorrow, in doing our best and supporting others to do theirs.\n\nOur founders knew professional and industrial environments constantly vary and that universities needed to equip their students with the skills to adapt and lead positive change for the future.\n\nWe’ve never lost sight of our progressive beginnings and everything we do—from education to research and community engagement—is designed to not only meet, but improve the new world our students, graduates and communities will encounter.",

        "University Introduction Content 1": "The vision of those who fought to establish Australia's first regional university at Armidale in northern NSW is still alive at the University of New England.\n\nThe story begins with the election, in 1920, of David Henry Drummond as representative of the Northern Tablelands in the NSW Legislative Assembly. \n\nDrummond was a foundation member of the New State Movement, which believed in the potential of New England to become Australia's seventh State – with, necessarily, its own educational institutions. His interest in education led to his appointment, in 1927, as Minister for Education in a newly-elected NSW Government.",
        "University Introduction Content 2": "One of Drummond's first achievements as Minister was the establishment of a teachers' college in Armidale – the first Australian college of its kind outside a capital city. When laying the foundation stone of Armidale Teachers' College in 1929 he said the community was, in effect, laying the foundation for a future university.\n\nT.R. FosterHe was right: the local movement to establish a 'northern university' intensified. In 1934, at Drummond's instigation and support, a community campaign began to raise money for the scheme. And the following year the Senate of the University of Sydney agreed in principle to the idea of opening an affiliated University College at Armidale.\n\nThe idea of a 'northern university' caught the imagination of Thomas Richmond Forster (pictured) of Abington Station near Armidale. Forster was the son-in-law of Frederick Robert White, a wealthy pastoralist who had owned grazing properties in the Upper Hunter, New England (including Abington) and Queensland. In the 1880s, F.R. White built a 45-room mansion, Booloominbah, to the north-west of Armidale as a home for his large family. By the mid-1930s, Booloominbah was unoccupied.",

Because of its age and reputation, UWA is classed one of the \"sandstone universities\", an informal designation given to the oldest university in each state. The university also belongs to several more formal groupings, including the Group of Eight and the Matariki Network of Universities. In recent years, UWA has generally been ranked either in the bottom half or just outside the world's top 100 universities, depending on the system used.",

From Andrew Inglis Clark to Sir Guy Green, Enid Campbell and Lara Giddings, we've always been distinguished by staff and students who strode along the sometimes rocky path of knowledge and discovery and then set out to make a better world.\n\nWe're also a prism through which Tasmania can look to the world and the world can look to Tasmania; a bridge from our island that connects people, geographies, cultures and ideas.",

This means, for example, that if your speaking is better than your writing, you will be placed in a higher level class for Listening & Communication than for Reading & Writing. This way, you can challenge yourself to improve in your strong areas and get some extra help to improve in your weak areas.",
